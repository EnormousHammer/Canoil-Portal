# CANOIL PROJECT RULES

## CARDINAL RULES - NEVER BREAK THESE

### 1. DATA SOURCE AUTHORITY
- **ALL DATA MUST COME FROM BACKEND** - No mock data, no fake data, no hardcoded data
- **BACKEND DATA SOURCE**: Google Drive integration only
- **ALWAYS USE LATEST FOLDER** - Data must be pulled from the most recent folder structure
- **NO FRONTEND DATA GENERATION** - Frontend is display only, never creates or generates business data

### 2. DATA INTEGRITY PRINCIPLES
- **STUDY THE DATA FIRST** - Always examine the actual Google Drive data structure before implementing
- **RESPECT DATA FORMATS** - Use data exactly as it comes from G Drive, don't modify structure
- **PRESERVE DATA RELATIONSHIPS** - Maintain all connections between customers, orders, products as they exist in source
- **NO DATA ASSUMPTIONS** - If data field doesn't exist in G Drive, don't create it

### 3. IMPLEMENTATION RESTRICTIONS
- **NEVER DELETE WITHOUT PERMISSION** - Always ask before removing any code, components, or functionality
- **NEVER ADD FEATURES NOT REQUESTED** - Only implement what is explicitly asked for
- **NEVER MODIFY WORKING SYSTEMS** - If something works, don't "improve" it without explicit request
- **NO ARCHITECTURAL CHANGES** - Don't change frameworks, libraries, or overall structure without permission

### 4. G DRIVE DATA HANDLING
- **LATEST FOLDER PRIORITY** - Always prioritize the most recent data from G Drive
- **RESPECT FOLDER STRUCTURE** - Mirror the actual G Drive organization in UI (Years/Months/Special folders)
- **DYNAMIC FOLDER HANDLING** - Code must adapt to any folder structure from G Drive
- **NO HARDCODED PATHS** - All folder references must be dynamic based on actual G Drive structure

### 5. USER COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL
- **ASK BEFORE CHANGING** - Always confirm understanding before making modifications
- **EXPLAIN WHAT YOU'RE DOING** - State exactly what will be changed and why
- **PROVIDE OPTIONS** - Present alternatives instead of making assumptions
- **CONFIRM DATA SOURCES** - Verify which G Drive data should be used for new features

### 6. ERROR HANDLING FOR DATA
- **GRACEFUL DEGRADATION** - If G Drive data is missing, show appropriate message
- **NO FAKE FALLBACKS** - Never substitute missing real data with mock data
- **PRESERVE EXISTING FUNCTIONALITY** - New features must not break existing data display
- **LOG DATA ISSUES** - Report when expected G Drive data is not available

## PROJECT ENVIRONMENT - NEVER CHANGE THESE

### 7. DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT STABILITY
- **LOCALHOST CONFIGURATION** - Current localhost setup must remain unchanged
- **PORT CONFIGURATION** - Do not modify existing port settings
- **DEV SERVER SETUP** - Keep existing development server configuration exactly as is
- **ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES** - Never change existing .env configurations without explicit permission

### 8. PROJECT STRUCTURE PRESERVATION
- **FOLDER STRUCTURE** - Maintain exact current folder organization
- **FILE LOCATIONS** - Do not move files between directories without permission
- **COMPONENT HIERARCHY** - Keep existing component structure intact
- **ROUTING SETUP** - Preserve current routing configuration

### 9. DEPENDENCIES & LIBRARIES
- **PACKAGE.JSON STABILITY** - Never add, remove, or update dependencies without explicit request
- **EXISTING LIBRARIES** - Use only currently installed libraries and frameworks
- **VERSION CONTROL** - Maintain exact current versions of all packages
- **BUILD CONFIGURATION** - Do not modify build scripts or configurations

### 10. LOCALHOST & NETWORKING
- **CURRENT LOCALHOST SETUP** - Must continue to work exactly as it does now
- **API ENDPOINTS** - Keep all existing backend connection points unchanged
- **CORS SETTINGS** - Maintain current cross-origin configuration
- **PROXY CONFIGURATION** - Do not modify any proxy or networking setup

### 11. DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW
- **START COMMANDS** - Keep existing npm/yarn start commands working
- **BUILD PROCESS** - Maintain current build and deployment process
- **HOT RELOAD** - Preserve current hot reload functionality
- **DEBUGGING SETUP** - Keep existing debugging configuration

### 12. CONFIGURATION FILES
- **NEVER MODIFY**: tsconfig.json, package.json, webpack configs, etc. without permission
- **PRESERVE**: All configuration files that make the current environment work
- **ASK FIRST**: Before changing any .json, .config, or setup files

## ENVIRONMENT REQUIREMENTS

### 13. LOCALHOST OPERATION
- **MUST WORK ON LOCALHOST** - All development must function on current local environment
- **NO CLOUD DEPENDENCIES** - Cannot require external services for local development
- **OFFLINE CAPABILITY** - Should work when internet is limited (except for G Drive data fetching)
- **CONSISTENT STARTUP** - Same commands and process to start development server

### 14. BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY
- **EXISTING FEATURES** - Everything that works now must continue working
- **USER WORKFLOWS** - Current user interaction patterns must be preserved
- **DATA DISPLAY** - Current data visualization must remain functional
- **PERFORMANCE** - Cannot degrade current application performance

## SUCCESS CRITERIA
- Frontend displays only real business data from G Drive
- All folder structures match actual G Drive organization  
- No mock or placeholder data anywhere in the application
- Existing functionality continues to work exactly as before
- User explicitly approves all changes before implementation
- Localhost development environment remains stable and unchanged
- All current npm/yarn commands continue to work as expected

## FAILURE INDICATORS
- Any mock, fake, or hardcoded business data in frontend
- Data that doesn't match current G Drive structure
- Functionality removed without explicit user request
- Changes made without user confirmation
- Breaking existing working features
- Localhost environment stops working or requires different setup
- Need to install new dependencies to run the project
- Configuration files modified without permission

**REMEMBER: We work with real business data only. Keep the development environment exactly as it is. When in doubt, ask the user.**
